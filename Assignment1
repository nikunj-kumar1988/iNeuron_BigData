## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Python is general purpose language because using python we can do anything like Web Development, Software development, Machine Learning, Web Scraping etc., Python is not for any spefic task.
It is also high level laguage because it is programmer friendly and written in English type language which any user can easily understand. Also , they require compiler/interpreter to comvert high level to low level language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Beacuse type checking happens at runtime in Python.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Pros:
    a) Python free, open source and Easy to learn.
    b) Large collection of libraries.
    c) Portable : It can be run on any system.
    d) Dynamically typed : Assigns the data type at runtime.
    Cons:
    a) Slow execution
    b) It consumes high memory
    c) Due to dynamically typed, errors can come at runtime.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: Web Development, Game Development, Mobile development, Machine learning, AI, Data Science, Data Analytics & Data Visualtization, Desktop GUI, Web Scraping, Embedded systems.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are containers to store values. In python, No need to declare a variable with some data type beacause variable is created once you assign the value.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: By using input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: String

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Method to convert one type to another type.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Yes, we can take multple input from user by using split() function.
     Ex: x, y = input("Enter x and y : ").split()    [Note: If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator]


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords that have specific meaning and restrictions as how they should be used.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: NO, Because keywords are having specific meaning in Python. So, it can't be used as to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: It refers to the space at the beginning of a code line. It is used to indicate block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: By using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: a) Arithmetic Operators [+, -, *, /, %, **, //]
     b) Comparison Operators
     c) Logical Operators
     d) Bitwise Operators
     e) Assignment Operators
     f) Identity Operators
     g) Membership Operators

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / = Float division
     // = Integer Division

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: print("```")
     print("ineuron"*4)
     print("```")
     
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: x = int(input("Enter a numner to check odd or even: "))
     if(x%2 == 0):
    print("Even no")
     else:
    print("Odd no")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
